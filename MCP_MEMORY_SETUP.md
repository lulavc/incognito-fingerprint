‚úÖ **Added to Cursor MCP configuration**
‚úÖ **Enabled in Cursor settings**
‚úÖ **Local storage directories configured**

## üîß **Configuration**

The memory servers are configured in `.cursor/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    "env": {
      "MCP_MEMORY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/.mcp-memory"
    }
  },
  "mem100x": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mem100x"],
    "env": {
      "MEM100X_DB_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/.mem100x"
    }
  },
  "memory-keeper": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-memory-keeper"],
    "env": {
      "MCP_MEMORY_KEEPER_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/.memory-keeper"
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ **How Memory Servers Work**

### **Basic Memory (@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory)**
- Stores simple key-value pairs
- Remembers conversation context
- Basic retrieval capabilities
- Good for simple use cases

### **High-Performance Memory (mem100x)**
- Vector-based similarity search
- Intelligent context detection
- High-speed processing (66k+ entities/sec)
- Advanced querying capabilities
- Best for complex projects and large datasets

### **Context Management (mcp-memory-keeper)**
- Project-specific memory banks
- Context-aware storage
- Long-term conversation retention
- Intelligent memory organization
- Best for maintaining project context

## üìã **Use Cases**

### **For Development Projects:**
1. **Code Patterns**: Remember frequently used code snippets
2. **Project Context**: Maintain understanding of project structure
3. **Debugging History**: Remember past debugging sessions
4. **API Usage**: Store API documentation and usage patterns

### **For Learning:**
1. **Concept Retention**: Remember learned concepts and explanations
2. **Problem Solutions**: Store solutions to common problems
3. **Best Practices**: Remember coding best practices and patterns

### **For Collaboration:**
1. **Conversation History**: Maintain context across sessions
2. **Decision Tracking**: Remember project decisions and rationale
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Store shared knowledge and insights

## üîç **Features Comparison**

| Feature | Basic Memory | mem100x | Memory Keeper |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Speed** | Standard | ‚ö° Ultra-fast | Standard |
| **Storage** | File-based | SQLite + FTS5 | File-based |
| **Search** | Basic | Vector similarity | Context-aware |
| **Scalability** | Limited | High (66k+/sec) | Medium |
| **Use Case** | Simple | Complex projects | Project context |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Verification**

To verify the installation:

1. **Check global installation:**
   ```bash
   npm list -g | grep memory
   ```

2. **Check storage directories:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .mcp-memory .mem100x .memory-keeper
   ```

3. **Test in Cursor:**
   - Ask the AI to remember something
   - Start a new conversation and ask it to recall
   - The AI should be able to access stored information

## üìö **Advanced Usage**

### **For Complex Projects:**
- Use mem100x for high-performance memory needs
- Store code patterns and architectural decisions
- Maintain debugging history and solutions

### **For Learning:**
- Use memory-keeper for concept retention
- Store explanations and examples
- Track learning progress

### **For Documentation:**
- Store project decisions and rationale
- Maintain API documentation
- Keep track of best practices

## üîÑ **Integration with Other Tools**

The memory servers work alongside:
- **Sequential Thinking**: Store reasoning patterns and solutions
- **GitHub**: Remember repository context and changes
- **Filesystem**: Store file-specific information
- **Web Search**: Cache research results and insights

## üéâ **Benefits**

1. **Persistent Context**: Maintain understanding across sessions
2. **Faster Development**: Remember code patterns and solutions
3. **Better Learning**: Retain explanations and concepts
4. **Improved Collaboration**: Share knowledge and context
5. **Efficient Problem Solving**: Access past solutions quickly

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

If memory servers aren't working:

1. **Check MCP server status** in Cursor
2. **Verify storage directories** exist and are writable
3. **Restart Cursor** to reload MCP configuration
4. **Check Cursor logs** for MCP server errors
5. **Verify installation** with `npm list -g`

## üìñ **Storage Locations**

- **Basic Memory**: `${workspaceFolder}/.mcp-memory`
- **mem100x**: `${workspaceFolder}/.mem100x`
- **Memory Keeper**: `${workspaceFolder}/.memory-keeper`

## üîí **Privacy & Security**

- All memory is stored locally in your workspace
- No data is sent to external servers
- Memory files can be backed up or deleted as needed
- Each project has its own isolated memory storage

## üìä **Performance Tips**

1. **Use mem100x** for high-performance needs
2. **Regular cleanup** of old memory data
3. **Backup important memories** to version control
4. **Monitor storage size** for large projects
