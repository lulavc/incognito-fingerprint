# Sequential Thinking MCP Setup

## üß† **What is Sequential Thinking?**

Sequential thinking is an advanced reasoning methodology that breaks down complex problems into step-by-step logical sequences. It helps AI assistants think more systematically and provide better solutions.

## üì¶ **Installed MCP Servers**

### 1. **@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking**
- **Version**: Latest (2025.7.1)
- **Purpose**: Core sequential thinking and problem solving
- **Features**: Step-by-step reasoning, thought branching, solution planning

### 2. **mcp-sequentialthinking-tools**
- **Version**: Latest (0.0.3)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced tools for sequential thinking
- **Features**: Tool recommendation, decision-making, adaptive thinking

## üöÄ **Installation Status**

‚úÖ **Both servers installed globally via npm**
‚úÖ **Added to Cursor MCP configuration**
‚úÖ **Enabled in Cursor settings**

## üîß **Configuration**

The sequential thinking servers are now configured in `.cursor/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
  },
  "sequential-thinking-tools": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-sequentialthinking-tools"]
  }
}
```

## üéØ **How to Use**

### **For Complex Problem Solving:**
1. Ask complex questions that require step-by-step reasoning
2. The AI will use sequential thinking to break down the problem
3. Each step will be clearly explained with logical progression

### **For Code Analysis:**
1. Present complex code problems or debugging scenarios
2. Sequential thinking will analyze the code systematically
3. Solutions will be provided with clear reasoning steps

### **For Decision Making:**
1. Ask for help with complex decisions
2. The AI will use structured thinking to evaluate options
3. Recommendations will be based on logical analysis

## üìã **Example Use Cases**

### **Problem Solving:**
```
"Help me debug this complex JavaScript issue with step-by-step reasoning"
```

### **Code Analysis:**
```
"Analyze this anti-fingerprinting code and suggest improvements using sequential thinking"
```

### **Architecture Decisions:**
```
"Help me decide between different approaches for implementing WebGL protection"
```

## üîç **Features Available**

### **Core Sequential Thinking:**
- Step-by-step problem breakdown
- Logical reasoning chains
- Thought branching and revision
- Solution planning and evaluation

### **Enhanced Tools:**
- Tool recommendation based on problem type
- Decision-making frameworks
- Adaptive thinking strategies
- Reflective analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è **Verification**

To verify the installation:

1. **Check global installation:**
   ```bash
   npm list -g | grep sequential
   ```

2. **Test in Cursor:**
   - Ask a complex question that requires reasoning
   - The AI should use structured, step-by-step thinking
   - Look for clear logical progression in responses

## üìö **Advanced Usage**

### **For Development Tasks:**
- Complex algorithm design
- System architecture planning
- Performance optimization
- Security analysis

### **For Learning:**
- Understanding complex concepts
- Breaking down difficult problems
- Learning new technologies systematically

## üîÑ **Integration with Existing Tools**

The sequential thinking servers work alongside:
- GitHub integration for repository analysis
- Filesystem access for code review
- Web search for research
- System tools for environment analysis

## üéâ **Benefits**

1. **Better Problem Solving**: More systematic approach to complex issues
2. **Clearer Explanations**: Step-by-step reasoning makes solutions easier to understand
3. **Improved Decision Making**: Structured analysis of options and trade-offs
4. **Enhanced Learning**: Better understanding of complex topics through logical breakdown

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

If sequential thinking isn't working:

1. **Check MCP server status** in Cursor
2. **Restart Cursor** to reload MCP configuration
3. **Verify installation** with `npm list -g`
4. **Check Cursor logs** for MCP server errors
